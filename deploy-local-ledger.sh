# Start by defining any necessary variables
# For example, the directory where your blockchain node software is located

BLOCKCHAIN_NODE_DIR="/path/to/blockchain/node"

# Navigate to the directory containing the blockchain node software
cd "$BLOCKCHAIN_NODE_DIR" || exit

# Start the blockchain node software
./start_node.sh

# Optionally, you might need to wait for the node to sync with the network
# This can be achieved using commands like `sleep` or by checking the status of the node

# Once the node is synchronized, deploy the local ledger
./deploy_ledger.sh

# Optionally, you might need to interact with the deployed ledger in some way
# For example, initializing smart contracts, deploying assets, etc.

# Additional commands as needed for post-deployment tasks

# End of script
